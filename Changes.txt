For my "improvements" I tweaked hyper parameters as followed:


Model 1:
{
1. changed learning rate from 0.0001 to 0.00014 in the adam algorithm

2. Turned down number of epochs from 100 to 50

3. Added 2 bilstm layers



Estimate:
 I changed the learning rate 0.00014 slighty increasing it hoping that this will be good for the reduced number of epochs now being trained.
    - I estimate this will cause some overfitting

In response I wanted to tune up some hyperparameters to combat this which is why I added 2 bilstm layers.

Conclusion: The changes I made to the model created predictions I did not expect. They seemed to break the model causing every hours piction to be a constant value.
this happed twice with the default model, which makes me ponder why this is happening.

}
